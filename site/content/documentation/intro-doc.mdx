## Prerequisites

You must use Typescript version: >3.4

The library depends on TypeScript's support for decorators.
Therefore you must enable `experimentalDecorators` and `emitDecoratorMetadata`.

```typescript
{
    "compilerOptions": {
        "experimentalDecorators": true,
        "emitDecoratorMetadata": true
    }
}
```

### Polyfills

This library will work with modern browsers and JavaScript run-times without the need for polyfills, however if targeting older browsers you will need to provide a polyfill for the following types:

- Map. Read about the Map type [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map).

This library also makes use of the `reflect-metadata` API for performing runtime introspection.
Most browsers will not support this therefore you must install this yourself.

```bash
npm install reflect-metadata
```

And you should import this module at the root of your application.

```typescript
import "reflect-metadata";
```

## Quick Start

## Dependency Injection

The MessageBroker class is decorated with @Injectable from @morgan-stanley/needle.
This means that it can be constructed by different DI frameworks.
For more information please refer to the [documentation for the Needle framework](https://github.com/morganstanley/needle).
