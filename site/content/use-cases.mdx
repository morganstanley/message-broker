Here is an example of a usecase in which the Message Broker could be useful.

#### Notification system

Let's say you have some document uploading functionality in your UI.
The uploading may take up to a minute and you don't want the user to have to wait, so once the upload is complete you want to have a pop-up notification appear which tells the user that their upload was successful.

The code for your pop-up notification can live anywhere in your codebase, and can "listen" for a "document_uploaded" message using the MessageBroker.
Now all that needs to happen is for the document upload service to publish that message when the upload completes.

**Note:** that with this model, our document uploading service doesn't even have to know about the existence of the notification service, so everything is nice and decoupled.

#### Mediator Pattern

More generically, the Message Broker essentially acts as a [Mediator](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/mediator) for your components.
Any time you would apply the Mediator pattern, the Message Broker is the perfect solution to avoid you some boilerplate coding.
