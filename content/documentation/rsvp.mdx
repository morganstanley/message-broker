The RSVP methods allow developers to define a request/response model using the messagebroker.
Unlike a normal publish, publishing on an RSVP channel is a synchronous call that will ask all subscribers to respond with some value.

An RSVP message must be sent on a special RSVP channel.
In order to create on of those, you should extend the IRSVPConfig interface in your Contract interface, which will require you to specify an `rsvp` section.
In this section, you can provide a channel name as usual, and it must have a `payload` and `response` section in it.

```typescript
interface IContract extends IRSVPConfig {
    nonRSVPChannel : string;
    rsvp: {
        myRSVPChannel: {
            payload: { data: string };
            response: number;
        };
    };
}
```

With your contract defined, you can now publish a message.

Remember, this call will be *synchronous*, so it will block until all the subscribers have completed their work and returned a value.

When all return values have been gathered, they will be returned by the rsvp method.

```typescript
const results: number[] = messagebroker<IMessageChannels>()
                            .rsvp('myRSVPChannel', { data: 'abcde'});
```

### Respond

Subscribing to an RSVP channel looks much the same as publishing, with the key difference being that the second parameter is a **function** rather than an object.
This function must take a parameter of the type that matches the `payload` type in your contract.
It must then return a value which is of the same type as the `response` type in your contract.

```typescript
messagebroker<IMessageChannels>()
    .rsvp('myRSVPChannel', payload => {
        // Perform some work on payload
        return len(payload.data);
    }
);
```

### Respond with manual disconnect

If for some reason you would like to stop responding to RSVP messages on a certain channel, the `rsvp` function returns a responder handler which has a `disconnect` method on it.
Calling this method will prevent any further messages being received.

```typescript
const responder = messagebroker<IMessageChannels>()
                    .rsvp('myRSVPChannel', payload => {
                        return payload.data.split('');
                    });

// Manually disconnect the responder to avoid handling further rsvp requests.
responder.disconnect();
```
